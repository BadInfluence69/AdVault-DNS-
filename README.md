AdVault DNS: a network-level Python DNS Adblocker
AdVault DNS is a Python-based DNS adblocker designed to eliminate intrusive advertisements and trackers at the network level, prioritizing user experience over ad revenue. 
Core features
Ad and Tracker Blocking: Blocks ads and trackers across all connected devices and applications by filtering out DNS requests to known advertising and tracking domains.
Privacy Protection: The service does not track, profile, or harvest user data, and all network traffic is analyzed solely for identifying ad patterns, without storing logs or personal information.
Network-level Blocking: AdVault operates at the DNS level, meaning it blocks ads and trackers before they can reach your devices, offering system-wide protection.
Open to the Public: AdVault is a free and open-source service with no restrictions, subscriptions, or hidden costs.
Windows Server Integration: Optimized for use on Windows Server for best results, it leverages Python Releases for Windows for seamless integration.
Faster, Cleaner, More Respectful Internet: Provides a faster, cleaner, and more respectful internet experience by reducing clutter and improving page load times.
DNS Filtering: Filters out unwanted content, including ads, trackers, malware, and phishing attempts, providing a more secure browsing experience.
Block Malware and Phishing: Beyond ads, it actively blocks access to known malicious and phishing domains to protect users from online threats.
Custom Blocklists: Allows users to create and manage their own blocklists for greater control over what gets filtered. 
How it works
AdVault DNS acts as a central point for resolving domain names to IP addresses. When a device connected to AdVault DNS attempts to access a website or app, it first queries AdVault DNS for the corresponding IP address. If the requested domain belongs to an advertising, tracking, or malicious entity, AdVault DNS intercepts the request and prevents access, effectively blocking the unwanted content before it can load. 
How to use
To leverage AdVault DNS, simply configure your device or router to use the provided DNS server address: 185.107.97.246. Refer to your device's or router's documentation for specific instructions on how to change your DNS settings. 
Benefits
Improved Performance: Removes ad-related content, leading to faster page loading and a smoother browsing experience.
Enhanced Privacy: Prevents companies from tracking your online activities and collecting your personal information.
Increased Security: Blocks access to known malware and phishing websites, protecting you from online threats.
Eliminates Annoyances: Reduces distractions from intrusive ads and pop-ups, creating a cleaner and more enjoyable internet experience.
System-wide Protection: Protects all devices connected to your network, including smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices. 
By utilizing AdVault DNS, users can actively participate in reclaiming their browsing experience, promoting user privacy, and fostering a healthier online environment.
