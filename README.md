Why This DNS Service Exists
This DNS service was created with a simple mission: to clean up the internet by eliminating intrusive advertisements and fighting back against the increasing prioritization of ad revenue over user experience.

There’s no tracking, no user profiling, and no data harvesting. This service does not collect personal information, device fingerprints, browsing history, or any identifiable data. The only network traffic reviewed is for the sole purpose of analyzing ad patterns—nothing is stored, and no logs are retained.

The goal is simple: give people a faster, cleaner, more respectful internet experience without the need for browser extensions or expensive hardware. It’s not about making money—it's about restoring quality and control to everyday browsing.

By pointing your device or router to this DNS, you're helping push back against the idea that users should be monetized before they’re respected. This service is open to the public, with no restrictions, no subscriptions, and no strings attached.

Clean the noise. Reclaim the web.
